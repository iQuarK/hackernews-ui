# UI for HackerNews using Lazy Loading and Bulma
As the topstories endpoint of HackerNews gives all the list in one request, it loads the pages in the client by slicing, to improve the performance I am using Lazy Loading.


## Use the right version of node
`$ npm -g install nvm` 
`$ nvm use`

## Install packages
`$ yarn`

## To run the client:
`$ yarn start`

## To run the tests:
`$ yarn test`

## To build the app for production:
`$ yarn build`
